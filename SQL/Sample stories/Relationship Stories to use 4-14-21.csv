He kept picking and picking trying to get me to say something but, I kept my cool and went on making dinner. I thought he was finally ready to give up as he started walking away.

I asked G if she really wanted to go and she said yes. I am not a traveler so I gave her the green light since she has never been there and hasn't seen any of her sisters for a number of years since she and I live in California. I had to take cash advances along with the small savings in order to buy the plane ticket and have enough money for her hotel, food and transportation. But I thought it was all worth it even though I felt angry that G decided to go during a time of lean finances for us both. I even had to get additional money for her while she was there because she ran out of money. But nevertheless I hunted around for that money and somehow found the money on my own through another cash advance credit card."

78,8,"My partner and I occasionally have disagreements about the way I approach social situations.  I am a somewhat unusual person, I was an only child of a navy family and I don't always approach situations from what my partner describes as an 'normal' perspective.  I can take issue with this, as I feel like what 'normal' is actually varies greatly from person to person.  Regardless, the image in my mind is of my partner visibly frustrated in our kitchen trying to explain to me what 'normal' social expectations are and getting more and more irritated by my different lived experience about these items.  It's not really an enjoyable discussion because they are conveying frustration with me, but I don't know how else to address the problem."

No matter what happens it's always she does nothing right and know it all is perfect. It doesn't make it any better that it is everybody that gets yelled at. She could leave but maybe it will pass when menopause passes or maybe it will get worse. Who knows? She is just tired of it and has started to strike back. Maybe that is the answer. "
90,12,Laying down on the couch while watching hell's kitchen with my husband.  Talking to him about a rocky relationship between a friend and I when my husband suggested maybe I'm just not good at emotions and inferring that it's my fault the friendship isn't working.

I started to tell my husband about the bird events outside, but was too loud and he literally said, ""shuush"" to ask me to be quiet. It made me feel like I was a small child, when I was supposed to be quiet, never loud or rock the boat. Literally seen and not heard. It made me feel quite sad, and a few tears even came to my eyes. My husband did feel bad for shushing me, and also said that he was just suffering from a headache. I didn't like this at all and felt quite bad at the time."

I didn't know him to flirt with her from her stories.  She had left that out.  She was surprised to see me and a little guilty looking.

I was trying to get dressed and brush my hair and everything I needed to go, and also get our one year old ready as well. I was changing his diaper, getting him dressed, and making sure his diaper bag was packed. I also had to make sure we had everything else we needed. I was upset with my husband because while I was doing all of this, he was painting some of his models for a tabletop game instead of helping. When I got upset with him after everything was ready, he got mad that I didn't ask him to help. I was mad that he thought I needed to ask for help instead of just helping without me asking. I was afraid he would be irritated with me if I told him I was annoyed. My parents would get mad at me for doing that as a kid, and my husband said that I should be over that by now because we have been together for six years. It really upset me when he said that and I didn't want to talk to him anymore. Eventually we both apologized but I still felt hurt by what he said. "
174,20,"I looked at the email and I saw the offer of the fitbit.  It felt like a betrayal.  It was clear to me that there was a desire to continue a connection.  It felt like actions and words weren't matching up.  I went back and looked at it again.  The phone felt heavy in my hand.  I felt justified in what I was doing.  I felt hurt.  I felt anger.  I began to fantasize about confronting her, but tried to tell myself not to.  I knew that I would anyway.  I felt angry at myself for continuing to be in this situation. I put the phone back where it was a couple times, and looked at it again a couple times to be sure I had read things correctly.  I felt afraid and stupid and thought I should be braver than I was in that moment.  But I knew deep down that I interpreted correctly what I saw and that words and actions were once again not matching up.  It's getting hard to keep writing. It was a small situation and I've basically described it here.  thee space just keeps getting longer and longer"
80,21,"My wife had just come home from spending the day with an old friend from her childhood. She had taken our infant daughter along and they had gone to hang out at the pool of her friend. She ended up bringing the friend home as well since he had nothing to do that evening. He ended up sticking around for most of that weekend and many others. While I had been fine with her old friend I was not happy that she'd brought him home to hang out. My wife and daughter lived in another state at the time and we only got the summer together while she was on break so our time was limited and precious. It angered me that she had decided to split that time between our family and this guy who did not have a life of his own. In the end it turned out that he had mental issues, possibly PTSD as he was a soldier, and the friendship soured. To me it felt like she'd wasted a lot of our summer by having this guy around who could have been dangerous."
128,22,"I called my husband 1 hour before his closing hour to ask if he was still up for our initially planned dinner date, he startled for a second and then grumpily replied that he was still on, but had to first pick up something for his brother before coming home. An hour past and he hadn't shown up I quickly called his brother to ask, only to find out that he was lying and hadn't gone to get anything for him. He showed up at home an hour late and requested I hear him out, that something really important came up at work which he volunteered to sought out on behalf of his organization and he had no choice but to lie."
124,23,"I am yelling with anger, asking how could I be betrayed and backstabbed like this. He is asking me, how did I betray you? I ask him, how is this not betraying my trust? Am I not supposed to feel hurt? You have humiliated me! I feel totally humiliated now! If anybody knew, if I were to tell anybody, I would be humiliated! This is completely humiliating to me! He merely says, nobody needs to know except for him and me. This doesn't concern anyone else. He did this and that's it. It involved him only. He did it, he paid for it to be done (literally and figuratively, in my mind) and that's it. It happened and it's over with now, he says. That is his justification. That is all he can offer me. He can say nothing else except for that. He cannot even offer so much as an apology in person. Yes, via text message, but text is one thing and in person is another. I will have to either accept it and live with it or let it eat me up."
72,24,"We had been married about 5 years and I don't know what triggered it, but we'd always joked with each other a lot.  There came a time when it felt like I couldn't ""pick"" with him anymore, because he immediately got defensive or angry.  We were facing off in the kitchen, which was a hideous yellow color.  I had my hands clenched and I was so angry and upset and over the whole thing, I finally asked him why we were even married, what was the point if he was going to get upset constantly.  He blew it off and looked irritated until I said ""I'm serious, why."" and I think he realized it was serious.  His expression changed from defensive to actually upset."

I see myself getting upset and starting to raise my voice.  I see myself talking about how upset I am - that I am upset because I think she is spending too much money on things that we don't need.  I see my wife responding and saying that they are things that she needs - that it's her money - that I should not be upset.  I see the argument go on for some time, with both of us arguing and generally being rigid in our positions.  I see myself getting more upset and saying hurtful things, until the conversation ends with us separating and going to different rooms."
39,26,"We were sitting in the living room of our house. I was on the couch under the front windows. She was on the couch opposite. We were talking about my gender identity issues. I don't think she was in a great head space, but I don't think that I picked up on it at the time. Later recalled thinking that I should have picked up in her tone of voice that she was already unhappy. But without much context she asked who I would I like to look like if I presented as a woman. I named someone without thinking much about it, but someone who is very femme. She said something to the effect that she could never be attracted to someone who looked like that."
1,27,"There is a family of four sitting at the table. On the table is fettuccini noodles, alfredo sauce, broccoli, chicken, and garlic knots. The woman is the last to sit at the table, and begins to serve everyone. After everyone has food, they begin eating. The man picks up a garlic knot, turns it over and observes it. He takes a bite, then looks at the woman. He asks her if she did anything different with the garlic knots. Perhaps she cooked them too long. The woman gets upset and tells the man that no, she cooked the  same amount of time. She just didn't use the silicone pad on the cooking sheet because she didn't want yet another dish to wash after dinner. She was tired after working all day, and had already spent over an hour making the garlic knots from scratch. The man looks at the woman, finished the garlic knot, and eats the rest of his dinner in silence. He doesn't eat another garlic knot, and the woman spends the rest of the dinner talking to the kids about their day."

Finally, she calls, and he can here in the background the driver calling out of the window, ""Thanks for the good time!"" In an outrage, he yells into the phone ""What the hell does he mean by that!"""
44,30,"To me, I see my partner as an arrogant person, she refuse to believe that she is at fault or even ask forgiveness. It was the wedding event of my good friend, I told my partner one month before the wedding, but because I shouted at her for wasting money on a single hand bag, except her to explain but she started keeping malice, on the day of the wedding, I taught she have forgetting about that but instead she told me that her childhood friend's wedding the same day."
215,31,"After not seeing my husband all day he came home and didn't say more that a few word to me and spend the next several hours on his phone looking at college football recruiting stuff. This hurt my feeling as I had been home with the baby all day with no adult interaction and look forward to him being home, but he seemed to be more interested in where 18 year old's are going to college to play football than he was in his wife and child. When I approached him on this he got defensive and all pissy. This leads me to not bring it up anymore because it makes my feeling seem irrational. "

He left the house about 4:30 in the afternoon for ""happy hour"" and came home around 2:00 am.  I then found a receipt from the bar they had gone to for $150, which meant he had probably been buying drinks for everyone he met that night.

When I pointed out that there was no cash in his wallet he continued to revise his lies until I just stopped talking to him altogether."

B, an alias for one of my co-workers, is talking about his travels and his freedom as a bachelor.

157,35,"I noticed some changes in her characters, I took my time to find out what was wrong but all she said was that she's fine. I knew something was wrong somewhere, then she started coming home late at nights, lying to me that she spends so much time at work. Then one day, I decided to go check her at her workplace around 5pm in the evening, then one of her colleagues told me she went on a date with a man, I got to know the address of the restaurant, I took a cab down there and to my utmost surprise, I met them kissing each other, she was shocked to see me.

I asked what he was talking about.  He said the amount of time I was spending with my family was too much.  I began pacing the kitchen back and forth.  I started crying.  We continued the discussion.  I pointed out the amount of time we spend with his family -weekly.  I noted that I only got to see my family about once a month.  My family was further away which took more time to visit- almost an entire day.  We came to an agreement about how much time to spend with each family without us feeling it was unfair.  "

Well my wife had been so use to me looking fit and having muscles and being in shape that that visual was stuck in her mind. well I started getting fat and she said she wasn't attracted to me anymore. 
63,39,I am imagining sitting in a chair. I am thinking about that I am waiting for a call. I am just sitting there and thinking the call could come. I am staring at the phone. It is getting late. I am wondering if the call is ever coming. It is getting just later and later. I am just going to change clothes now. I'm going to eat a snack. I'm going to go about my evening.

This single act made the man so furious and angry."
150,41,I am observing myself and my romantic partner in a discussion at a restaurant.  I can see them both speaking passionately and they are both somewhat animated when they speak.  They are discussing responsibility and maturation as an adult and my partner is mentioning that they think I was coddled growing up and lack responsibility in adulthood in certain areas.  I am responding and denying this notion vigorously while she listens and continues to speak.  I can picture the bar and table where we are seated vividly and the reaction of each partner as they continue to converse. 
197,42,"I am sitting on the couch next to my wife, and we have three other family members visiting. We are all in the living room playing a video game by the name of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch Entertainment System. The five of us play against each other and it quickly becomes clear that I am the best player at the game. My wife becomes upset at losing the game and lashes out at the rest of us.

She told me that we would finish up what we were doing but then she was going with her other friend. Normally this is fine by my but this was interfering with what we had already set time aside for. I wasn't happy and I made that clear. I felt neglected and possessive at the same time although that's not normal for me. I was really upset that she'd just abandon our plans for something that wasn't a serious issue or for someone who really wasn't in need of anything detrimental at that moment. We both apologized to each other the following day.

The male is pacing in from the bedroom and takes a route to the main front door, turns around and paces back through to the bedroom. He appears agitated and angry. The female is sitting on the couch near the mid-point of his pacing path. Her eyes are puffy and there is a tissue box beside her, clearly being used.

107,54,"My wife just bought a very expensive vacuum cleaner that was much more than our budget. She bought it right after we had an argument, probably about money, but it was definitely not specifically about the vacuum cleaner. The point is, I hated the vacuum cleaner with a passion and resented it every time I used it because I thought it was under-powered and not reliable enough to justify all of the cost. I didn't yell, but I gave my wife the silent treatment for a while and she did the same to me. This was one of our biggest fights, and neither of us can believe it's over a stupid vacuum cleaner. But of course, it's about more than just that - it's about what the vacuum represents."

She had her arms crossed which I noticed, and tried to make sure I did not mirror, since I feel that crossing arms leads you to be more defensive. I tried to explain and diffuse the situation but it just wasn't working out, and eventually she just apologized and walked away to end the conversation. I was left frustrated that I wasn't trying to cause any issues, and just get some good planning going, but was unable to. I'm not sure how my face looked, but I was trying to keep it as neutral as possible. "
81,57,"I'm sitting with my partner, complaining on how an event unfolded. She seems to understand but is not very interested as I have made the same complaint before. Later, she tells the person I was complaining about, how I felt. This wasn't something I wanted her to share. I see her telling this person, and he looks down and is disappointed, but I think he understands my frustration. Later, he confronts me and I can see he wanted me to tell him directly, he'd rather hear this from me, and not be told second hand. I agree, but by my body language I can tell that I'm uncomfortable while talking about all of this. "
112,58,"I had some Visa gift cards that I was going to use to buy Kroger gift cards. My husband was going to complete the transaction. There were about three individual gift cards. I was setting up an account that needed to link to our Kroger account at a later date. As I scrolled through, I saw that one of the gift cards had been used to purchase a Playstation gift card instead. I immediately confronted him about this. We have had trust issues in the past, so this is very concerning for me."
13,59,Three people talking at a bar that is crowded. Two people wander off and mix in to the crowd and the third is left alone not knowing where the other two went or what they are doing and seems concerned.
205,60,"I remember this event occurring during warmer weather.  It started out inside our house.  My wife got upset because I did not complete a household chose to her liking.  She was frustrated and continued to dwell on it.  I went outside to do somethings and speak to the neighbors.  She came outside and asked for me to come home.  When we crossed paths she yelled ""I hate you."" I ignored her and went on to complete my things."
52,61,"My wife was attending an HOA board meeting with other members of the HOA board. She asked me to be present at the meeting as well to observe how the other members treated her. She had told me previously that the other members did not listen to her, belittled her, and tried to brush off her ideas, and she wanted me to witness it. The meeting got very heated because my wife was correct, the other members were doing all she said, and it was making her angry. She finally had enough of the hate, called one of the board members an ugly name, and quit the meeting. I didn't agree with her that she should have called the board member a name, because they could  come after her for slander, but I completely understood why she was so upset."
106,62,"I am sitting on the couch and my wife is sitting on a chair in front of me. We are in our living room on a cold fall day talking about my parents and how my mom said something that upset my wife. My wife said something to the effect of ""My mom and me have made selfish decisions our whole life."" She later apologized for saying this, but at the time it upset me. I remember looking down at the floor when she said this, feeling upset and troubled. After she left I sat in the same place and gazed out the window and tried to cool down. She came back about 15 minutes later and we talked things out."
162,63,"A woman is sitting in a hospital bed. She is almost 41 weeks pregnant, and they need to induce labor so that she can deliver her child. A man is also there, her husband. He brought her to the clinic in a taxi, but he said that he must go back to work. This is their third and most likely last child together. The husband asks the nurse attending the woman in labor if it would take long, the nurse answers yes, that he should go to work as it most likely would take a while. The man then leaves, telling his wife that he'll be back later. The wife smiles and nods at him, telling him to have a good day at work. Behind the smile though, her eyes betray that she is rather upset that her husband is leaving her there to labor alone. As the nurses increase the pitocin and her contractions become more and more intense, the woman seems worried. About an hour and a half after her husband leaves for work, after an intense and painful labor, the woman delivers a healthy 8.5 pound baby boy."
183,64,"I asked my husband if we could maybe play with cards that I had purchased from Amazon that have various questions for partners to ask one another. I had specifically spent money buying these in order for us to have an activity to do together to bond and also because I feel like most nights we end up just sitting on the couch, barely talking. When I asked him if we could do this, he said he didn't really feel like it. It hurt me because a) he hadn't taken any initiative to figure out something to do b) I had spent money on these cards and it now felt like a frivolous purchase and c) it felt like he didn't want to spend quality time with me which was hurtful and made me upset."
66,65,"So the guy had already planned a decent birthday dinner for his girlfriend because he was cash crunched at the time. However, the girl receives a text from one of her admirers asking her about her birthday party. The girl said its just a small dinner. The admirer then told her to come over to his place that he could do a big party for her and she went. The guy was devastated"
116,66,"She was warming up lunch.  Now she is sitting on the sofa while the food is cooking, and she is discussing potential fence stains with her husband.  Her husband is emptying the dishwasher.  ""This didn't get clean,"" he says with frustration.  ""Well that didn't clean, either."" he said.  ""Nothing got clean!"" he said.  The dishwasher was full of a few large pots and pans from the night before of heavy cooking.  ""Those are big pots and pans"", she said, ""the dishwasher isn't good at getting those clean.  ""It's because you didn't put it on the heavy duty setting!  Whenever you run the dishwasher, you run it on the normal setting and nothing ever gets clean!  You always run it that way!""   ""Do you hear what you are saying to me?  The dishwasher didn't get the huge pots clean and automatically you just start blaming me.  Why do you do that?  Why is every random thing that goes wrong somehow, some way always linked back to me?"" she said.  "
153,67,I am picturing my wife and I standing there arguing about money. Her giving me crap about the money I have lost on sports betting and not being able to agree on a path forward on investing money. I am articulating so many ideas on how to invest the money that we have and she is not listening since she thinks I am dumb for losing the money that I lost. She doesn't appear to have any trust in me after that event and now we are in a point of contention going forward on all things related to money. This event happened around 2 plus years ago and at this point I wanted to invest in bitcoin. Imagine where we would have been if it was a yes.
3,68,"Husband had just started his new job and I knew he had a busy day and was going to be in meetings most of the day. I hadn't had much time with him lately and although he was in meetings, I'd hoped for a few messages throughout the day -- especially because I was having a trying day myself. He messaged me a couple of times but the messages were few and far between --even on his breaks he didn't take the time to call or exchange more than 1 message in less than twenty minutes. He only asked me one question in his messages the whole day and I felt really saddened and unimportant by these actions. "
176,69,After engaging in an argue with my wife we had been upset to one another for a long period of time.  We had an argue about our relationship. And she took it to the next level. At the end she admitted her fault but that really made me sad.     
30,70,"Sometimes in 2019, my Spouse and I made an arrangement to travel to Kenya for a vacation. My Spouse never told me he had cancelled all plans for the trip. He only told me three days to the trip. I was very furious on why he could do such a last minute cancellation. He told me he already cancelled it a month back due to financial constraints. The most annoying part was him sponsoring his mother's birthday a month after cancelling the Holiday."
10,71,"It shouldn't have gotten to that. A young black girl in her early twenties yelling at her boyfriend in the park at the still of the evening. It started with her boyfriend asking why she doesn't trust him and finds it hard to believe whatever it is he says. She didn't seem to be interested at first but he kept talking and it was as though she had enough already. ""I'm not a fool"" she yelled ""where were you last night"" I tried your phones but both lines wouldn't go through. I sent you a text, you read but you wouldn't reply. Only for me to go your apartment and find another lady's car parked outside. You lied to me, man, you lied!! I trusted you with everything but how do you pay me? Just leave me alone"
160,72,"My college date stood me up. It was early in our relationship and we had made plans to go out I came by the dorms to take her out, but she was gone and her room mate was unsure where she went or when she would return. So, bruised ego and unhappiness. Called the next day to find out what happened and she said her high school girl friend had arrived from out of town and they had gone into the city for the day. My beef (verbalized) was that she could have at least called to let me know.  I understood the surprise visit and would have been fine with postponing our date, but was unhappy about not being considered. Not so much angry as disappointed  sort of an index to how much I mattered"
151,73,"This happened earlier this week. I had just finished work. I was feeling tired from the long weekend. My wife also had just come home from work. The event happens in the kitchen, while my wife is in the living room with our daughter. I am making dinner and make a comment about how I need help with dinner. This turns into an argument where my wife tells me I don't do enough around the home. Our daughter is playing with toys, while my wife and I argue about me helping more around the house. I was visibly hurt, because I felt I had been doing quite a bit to help. My wife was hurt, because she felt that she had already done so much to help and needed a break. The argument takes place in front of the kitchen sink, which is next to the island in the kitchen. The island is also next to the oven/stove, which is where dinner was being prepared."
115,74,"She is sitting at the dinner table with a meal laid out.  Her husband walks in and grabs  some food but says he has to run, he's playing disc golf.  She worked all day then fixed dinner for the two of them, but he just picks up what he can eat on the go and leaves.  She is all alone now while he is off with his friends.  She looks at the food on the table but is no longer hungry.  She stands and packs everything away in the refrigerator.  She appears sad to have been left alone.  She watches tv by herself while he is out.  She is asleep in bed by the time he finally gets home."
195,75,"I was actually at home.  My wife was out with friends out of town.  She was at a resort for a party with about 5 or 6 of her friends.  I recall she had mentioned that she was having a good time and that she would call me before she went to bed.  I never heard back from her.  I called one of her friends that was there with her and she answered drunk and could not communicate with me well enough.  My wife called me the next day to tell me her cellphone had died and that she had not been having a good time because everyone was getting too wasted, which she isn't into.  So she returned back to the room early to charge her cell phone and fell asleep.  I was still disappointed. "
36,76,"My mother-in-law took our child for the weekend and then refused to bring him home. The police would not get involved and my wife was reticent to go after her stepmother for the issues that were occurring, so we had a big fight. I ultimately contacted Child Protective Services, which led to a protracted battle that did ultimately result in the return of our child. I spent most of the time furious and anxious. I spoke to the authorities a lot and fought with my wife who was just as upset as I was, but of course had other priorities in addition to my own. It was a very tense time, but we managed to work through it and ended up stronger for it. However, I never wish to see or hear from my stepmother-in-law again and neither does my wife."
165,77,"During our courtship days, my partner was double dating, dating me and another individual, when I discovered I became sad."
75,78,"We are moving a bench in the back yard.  As soon as we reach the spot where we want to place it for the summer my wife asks me ""Is this where you want to put it?""  I say, ""Of course"". She then proceeds to say in a rather snippy voice ""Don't be so crabby!"".  I look at her quite surprised and can feel my anger start to boil up.  I had broken her of the habit of calling me stupid and the like but not crabby.  Rather than getting into an argument with her I walked  to the edge of the yard where I sat down on the electrical box holding the electrical gear for the neighborhood with my back facing her. Later that day we had a discussion about name calling."
119,79,"A man downloaded snapchat and his wife didn't know. His wife's friend told her that he had a snapchat. When the wife asked the man about the snapchat, he said he would delete it. A couple of weeks passed and she found out he did not delete it and he was sending snaps to a girl that the wife did not like. When asked about the snapchat again, he said he was going to delete his entire account and delete the application for good. He did it in front of her, but at this point she does not believe that he has really given up the application for good and she thinks that he will be making a new profile once he is able to. Her trust for him is completely broken. I am the wife in the scenario and my husband is the man. "
202,80,"There are two 1000 piece puzzles on the dining room table at either end. The woman is hunched over her puzzle, concentrating very hard.  She is picking up pieces, putting them in a spot, only to discard them.  The man comes along, and spends a moment watching her.  They are talking about the puzzle, how the pieces are not uniform in size, how the colors look alike, how two pieces could go in different places and look like they fit, and basically how difficult this puzzle is for the woman.  The woman points to a spot on the puzzle and says how easy it should be to find that piece, but she hasn't found it yet.  The man reaches over, picks up a puzzle piece, and slides it into the spot that she was just talking about, saying, 'there it is' and walks away. "
143,81,Walking out of an establishment to find my ex-girlfriend with someone else that was much older. Discussing her attitude towards the situation led me to discover that the relationship was over.
12,82,"I was in our apartment in Tokyo at the time and my husband called me to say that he was on his way home. We had been having conflict over a volunteer job at a lifeline he had been doing and how much extra time he had been spending there. I asked him if he was delayed because he stopped by the lifeline's office. He said he was not and said he'd be home in about a half hour. I was sitting in our living room talking to him on our land line. When he got home, I wanted to be intimate with him and we started to fool around a bit, but he said he couldn't do it. We were sitting on our bed and I was confused and worried. He told me that he had lied to me when he said he hadn't stopped by the lifeline's office. He didn't want to get into an argument with me so he lied. My husband had never lied to me before and he couldn't be intimate with the guilt of that lie sitting with him. He was extremely upset at himself and apologetic. He said he didn't know how I could ever forgive him and how his lying wouldn't place a shadow over my ability to trust him from that point forward. I sat on the end of the side of the bed thinking about what he'd said and done. I was very angry, but I said in a very level voice that I forgave him and wouldn't factor this one lie after more than 20 years of marriage into our future communication. He asked me how I could do that just like that. I told him that it was too important not to forgive him, but this was the one and only time that would be possible. He has not lied to me since then. "
164,83,"In our early days in dating, I caught my partner flirting with someone else, I felt really rejected and sad about this."
130,84,"J and M are having a disagreement. She is saying that M is behaving like his father. This is very hurtful, as she knows that he strongly dislikes his father and being compared to him is the ultimate insult. M tells J that he thinks she is being mean for the sake of being mean and throwing out a low blow. J doubles down and says that she doesn't know what he means by that and just calling it like she sees it. She begins to list all of the specific traits that are reminding her of M's father. M gets more and more upset and begins to cry. J continues to list adjectives despite M's tears and reaction to the cruelty."
149,85,My husband and I were discussing whether to keep our kids in all-virtual learning or let them return to hybrid learning. I said that I thought we should consider sending them back to school for hybrid learning because they really miss their friends and need the socialization. I think the schools are being pretty careful about masking protocols and COVID safety. My husband started yelling at me and saying he did not think hybrid is safe and that he was concerned that the cases were rising. I felt like he did not consider my point of view or the kids' points of view at all. I felt very hurt. It was as though he thought only his opinion mattered.
137,86,I'm buying some clothes for my baby online and there are some cute dresses. My baby is a boy but gender doesn't really matter that young. I buy a plain black dress. It's easier to change diapers in a dress. I decide to ask my husband if he minds. It turns out that he does mind and he thinks it's weird to dress our son that way. I'm non-binary and it hurts my feelings that he's so attached to the binary ideas of gender. It's not like I was asking to send him to his grandparents in a dress. I just thought it would be easier to change him and also I don't care about gender. My husband admitted that it shouldn't have been weird but that he thought it was anyway.
28,87,I saw a married couple arguing over a decision that was made without the other parties knowledge. It looked like a careless decision that should have been discussed by both parties but selfishness played a key role in the argument.
178,88,We had an argue about our relationship. And she took it to the next level. At the end she admitted her fault but that really made me sad. After engaging in an argue with my wife we had been upset to one another for a long period of time.   
127,89,I felt betrayed and unloved. I felt I had put all my trust in the wrong person. I was angry at him and didn't even want to see his face but I also was angry at myself for not knowing better and for having gotten myself into the situation. I remember we were both in the living room. the curtains were closed and the room was dark. It was the afternoon. The room was messy. I felt irritated that the room was messy. He wasn't wearing his glasses and his eyes were red. His tennis shoes were on. He had his hands balled into fists.  He kept making excuses and wanting to talk over me. We had just gotten the new couch. I already didn't like the color of that couch because it clashed with the drapes in a weird way. The kids were playing outside and I could hear them and the dog. I knew it was time to call the kids in and I didn't want to sit there and continue to hear him talk and talk and not to be able to talk myself. I just wanted him to go away already and leave me alone so I could absorb what had happened and figure out how to handle it myself. I felt like a dark cloud had descended over me and I just wanted to start making it get better immediately. I remember just looking at the curtains that were closed and wishing that I was somewhere else or that I was just someone else. Anyone else. I didn't care what he was feeling or thinking. I just wanted him to be away from me so that I could start making everything better. He kept putting his feet on the couch with his shoes and even though I didn't really like that couch it was making me irritated and angry that he kept putting his shoes on the new couch. I felt that he was disrespectful in many ways. I questioned my choice in men. I questioned all of my choices. I really just wanted to scream but his tone of voice made me feel like I was being irrational and overly emotional in the situation. I thought of who I could call to help me but I couldn't think of anyone who would be able to help me in that situation. I felt very alone and overwhelmed. I resented just having to sit there and listen to what he was talking about like I owed him that.
144,90,"When our family gathers together for a holiday (most recent was this past Christmas), it's as if I become invisible.  Things I say are not heard; things I do are not observed.  What's particularly annoying is that my wife is just as much a contributor to this phenomenon as all the rest.  If I say something with enough volume to be heard, she gets very annoyed and listens through obligation rather than interest.  Consequently, after years of this repetitive behavior, I have learned to just be quiet and stay as far in the background as possible.  Rarely am I ever missed."
61,91,"So I have an ongoing problem with my wife. We have been married quite a long time and she doesn't listen when I tell her something. This just happened last week. We were in the kitchen getting dinner ready. We usually talk about our day during dinner time. She was going on about her adventures for that particular day talking about how work went and her car is making a strange noise and her mother is driving her crazy as usual. I am usually a pretty active listener, giving eye contact nodding here and there and responding when necessary. Boy, would I like the same from her. On this particular evening she was an extremely poor listener when it was my turn to speak. When it was my turn to speak, I was stirring the sauce for dinner and telling her the story about the dog for that day. He is older and not feeling well. Of course she interrupted as usual and then she completely changed the topic back to her day. I felt like dumping the sauce on her head but of course I didn't. We have been together 24 years now and I must say it is getting worse. As usual I continue making dinner stopping my story midway. I didn't even try to get in the details of the rest of my day. Oh well another day in marriage."
110,92,"My boyfriend and I broke up over religion. We were in a relationship for four years and a couple of months ago, both his parents (who are Jewish) and my parents (who are Hindu) made us break up with each other because both families believed that there was no future for us. His Jewish parents didn't want a Hindu daughter-in-law and my parents felt the same about him. Although we had tried for the past four years to get our parents to accept the other, they never did, which always led to arguments. We continue to remain friends now and it breaks my heart every time I see him because I still love him immensely."
87,93,"I had just finished watching the news about something going on at the nations capitol. I was shocked and horrified about what was going on. My husband is a staunch republican and I am not, so he walked in the room and placed blame on the wrong individuals, when clearly it was the group of people I thought it to be. He said, as he often does, that it would come out in the end who is responsible after an inquiry came out. It was very frustrating to see this all happen and him not seeing it for what it is because of his political affiliation. We went to bed somewhat angry with one another because we were not seeing eye to eye and I was very upset. "
41,94,"I was talking about some difficulty I had at work and my wife was not really paying attention. This was frustrating for me, because I listen to her complain about work almost every day and I only rarely complain about work. She kept changing the topic to other things like her own work, or my son, or things we had going on. It was frustrating and so I pointed out that I listen when she is upset about something at work and she should do the same for me. She seemed kind of annoyed but was able to listen for about a minute or so without ignoring me or changing the topic. I felt somewhat better afterwards but I was still somewhat frustrated that I had to ask her to do something I do for her all the time."
91,95,"My husband thought our new mail carrier and I were flirting with each other. I like to get the mail as soon as it arrives and so I introduced myself to our new carrier. Now our mailman will always bring packages to the door and if it is not outside I will offer him a bottle of cold water. My husband wasn't teasing, he believes something is going on. We have been married awhile and have three children under 4. I don't think the mall carrier is looking for an immediate family. At first I thought my husband was just teasing me but now I am not sure. Has been going on since summer. Never saw him get this jealous over a mailman. All about trust to me. "
68,96,She is upset with him because he has walked by the laundry basket several times without carrying it upstairs.  He responses with I had to come in and clean off the counter because it was full of bags.  She responses with I was going to get to that in a little bit.  He response well I was going to get to the laundry basket in a little bit.  She sighs and says how many days is a little bit?  He walks away.  
103,97,I am in our shared bedroom talking about why I was letting our daughter watch a YouTube video that had a few bad words in it.  My wife was getting angry with me because I didn't make her change the video and felt like she was being the bad guy in the relationship.  I felt angry because the day earlier my daughter was watching a PG-13 movie with my wife and there were a few bad words in that one too and they continued watching the movie together.  I felt like that the no bad words policy was only applying to me and I told my wife that which she felt was not the case.  Eventually we had resolved the issue and made amends.
16,98,"I cooked a nice dinner for my husband, but I didn't know that he would be home late. He didn't even let me know that he was going to be staying at his work later than usual. He arrived home 2 hours late, and by then, the dinner I made was cold. I was mainly angry because he didn't even bother letting me know that he was going to be late due to his work. He apologized for being late and not letting me know, but I was still a little upset because I feel like I wasted my time cooking dinner for him."
198,99,"It was not to long ago when my husband suddenly decided that he wanted a new car. The car he owned at that time was perfectly fine. It ran well and never gave us huge problems. Well not only that he wanted a different car, no, it has to be a 1964 Ford Thunderbird. I told him that I think it is a beautiful car but old cars need the owners to have time and money. We are a great team and usually make all the decisions for our family together but this time he just did not care about my opinion. Like a little child that hardheadedly insists on his toy. I was mad that he handled it this way and disappointed and  sad too. He ended up buying that stupid car without my saying and spend a lot of money on it already... "
7,100,"I am talking to  my girlfriend.  She has dark brown eyes and black hair that goes past her shoulders.  We are in her room, talking about something that happened.  She is shy and doesn't want to talk about what she is feeling.  I persuade her to tell me what she is thinking in that moment.  It is late at night, dark outside.  There is a street light that is providing some illumination into the room.  But we are alone in her room, and can hear her friends outside talking and laughing.  We are sitting on the edge of her bed.  The covers are thrown back a little bit.  I am holding her hand as we talk.  She seems very afraid and not confident to talk.  I tell her it is okay."
192,101,"In watching this interaction between these two, it is clear that R makes very negative and judgmental comments about B. He describes B's decisions as if he did no processing of information and gave no thought of what would be the ""correct"" response. By correct response it appears that it must always fit into what R considers as the correct response. It seems like not only are B's feeling hurt, but he's angry and frustrated. "
86,102,"I see myself sitting in one of the cafe tables. She's been texting him, asking if they're still meeting today. He replies one time, accusing her of something. She is confused, and asking him what does he mean. He never replies again. She is frantically trying to figure out what she did wrong, and how she should talk to him. She is thinking, maybe if I said it in a different way, he won't ignore me. She is so frustrated, she gets up and goes to his home, but he is not there. She is pretty desperate, she likes this guy so much but he treats her like a dirt."
138,103,"L and N want to buy a house. L has been working really diligently to raise her credit score so that she is a more attractive borrower to a bank. N has better credit than L, but makes significantly less money. N is also in school full time right now, and lives 90 miles away during the week and comes home on the weekend. Today I saw N casually tell L that he over-maxed his credit card and he owes his credit card company a lot of money. All of this was news to L. She is angry that she didn't know about this, and even more so hurt that N doesn't understand how much this will set them back in their quest of securing a mortgage."
135,104,"I see the look on her face when she tells me that she has to cancel our plans. We were going to have a nice night out between the two of us, but she has a friend from college who is struggling with something. She has decided she needs to spend the time to talk on the phone with the friend rather than go out. She doesn't look me in the eye often except when giving details about the friend's struggles. She's not sure whether the friend is really in a bad place or is faking it or something, but she thinks the likelihood of it being real is large enough that she wants to cancel on us for the friend."
23,105,"I have made very specific vacation plans for my partner and myself. These plans were made very far in advance and he knew about the vacation plans and had already put in for vacation time from his job well ahead of time. As the day draws near he suddenly has to work and refuses to take the time off, even though it has already been approved a long time ago through the appropriate managerial channels. It is simply a personal choice that he decided to not take the time off of work and go on the vacation with me as we have previously planned and discussed."
101,106,The couple is having a tense disagreement via text message. She is at work texting with him while he is at work. She wants to have their child's birthday party at her parents' house because they have a pool and they didn't come up with another venue soon enough. There's not much time left to plan the party and this would be free and logistically simple. He does not want to have it there because he feels like his in-laws would be too involved in the planning and his own family would look critically at the situation. They are at an impasse and she is upset about the situation.
196,107,"Man and woman sitting on the couch. Both are a little tipsy from the evening events. She wants to watch a movie. He notices that the kids are asleep. He suggests they go to the bedroom and get intimate. She changes the subject as if he was just joking. He then says ""The kids are asleep. Do you want to go to the bedroom.""

191,108,"In the middle of an outdoor cafe, the couple sitting at the table nearest me began to have a conversation about planning a trip to visit his relatives in Canada, even though there is a mandatory two week quarantine once they arrive. Neither of them wanted to go, but they felt obligated due to health concerns of his father. Because he and his father have a terrible relationship, just discussing the trip made the man snappy and short and irritable. His companion was trying to be patient as she recognized his pattern whenever he discussed his father, but eventually, she had had enough of his curtness and told him to get over himself."

In fact, there are more dishes in the pile than there were when I was told they would be washed. I am standing with my hands on my hips in disbelief and frustration. My body language shows it. I am staring at them for some time before I throw my hands up in frustration and walk out of the room. I come back with my phone in my hand and call her.

My wife says that she is frustrated with our house being older and not comfortable in the winter or the summer and that she wants to look for a new house. I tell her that I'm okay with that but that I feel like this conversation is like a yo-yo because she'll have periods where she likes things about the house and wants to do a lot of work and times where she hates the house and there are a lot things that she thinks would be a waste of money to spend to try to fix. I look at the ceiling frustrated because I don't feel like there is anything that I can say or do to satisfy her and watch the ceiling fan spin. "

She was telling how she did not like it and I had not done a very good job. This definitely hurt my feelings because I had worked so hard at it. I remember seeing her face as she was telling me. She did not look happy. She looked a little scared to tell me it seemed. I know that she wasn't trying to hurt my feelings, but she did. I know that I will get over it, but I kind of did not want to talk to her for a little while. She apologized to me and said she wished she had not said anything. I did forgive her because I love her very much. "

Now a woman enters the room and I can see they start a conversation - I can't hear exactly what's occurring, however, I realize there is a brief amount of loud back and forth dialog and then the woman leaves the room.  She does not look happy.  The man stops his laundry folding and sits on the edge of the bed - he looks both surprised and distressed.   He sits there silently for a bit - I can see he's still distressed. He gets up, makes a phone call, talks to someone for a bit, then leaves the room.

Our daughter is five and she is still learning. I got into an argument with my wife and told her to stop being so demanding and critical of our daughter. I know my daughter was hearing all of this because she was right there in the room. My wife argued that our daughter needs to do a better job of listening. Though I agree, I do not think yelling is the way to achieve this and I think we need to be more selective about what we get upset about. "

The double shock of a surprise pregnancy and the betrayal of the affair was almost too much for me! I was in such a whirlwind of emotions! I had been wanting another baby for 5+ years and we had not been using any protection so after 8+ miscarriages, I had pretty much given up on the possibility of having another child.

Evidently, when he and A began dating, they soon purchased a house together. A year later, the husband discovered that A had been having multiple affairs. They supposedly broke off their relationship but continued to live together as roommates. Shortly there after, the husband met his current wife. The wife didn't realize that her husband and A had been lovers and viewed A as only his roommate. A moved but then returned for a visit 6 months after the husband and wife had gotten married. The husband invited A over to his new home with his new wife. His wife was initially okay with this, however, once A arrived, the husband began flirting really hard with her. In fact, he could not take his eyes off of her and A appeared to also be flirting back. The wife was really hurt by this and seeing her husband's infatuation with this current lover was very hurtful to say the least. A is a very beautiful woman and is also Asian to boot. She is well educated with a very prestigious job. Even though the husband has always pledged his love to his wife, it is unknown as to if he had preferred to ultimately end up with A. The husband had previously told his wife than in addition to A's multiple affairs, she had also done a lot of other very deceitful things and he considers himself as to have dodged a bullet. This is why it made it doubly hurtful that he would flirt with her so intensely and in front of his wife. In addition to being beautiful, A also wore a low cut blouse and tight jeans. A and the husband made intense eye contact many times during the two hours that A was visiting.  a mentioned that she had reservations at a pricey hotel nearby. The husband tried and tried to get her to stay there with the wife, he stated they had more than enough room (not true) so that A could stay in the comfort of our home and not have to be bothered with a hotel. To A's credit, she declined the invitation.  However, before she left, she and the husband began reminiscing about the times they were together. This included trips they took, stores they shopped at, concerts they attended, etc.  The husband had such sparks of joy in his eyes. It was so hurtful to the wife as it was as if he wife wasn't even in the room.  In truth, he was only with A in a relationship for a total of one year yet they appeared to have been together for a lifetime. The wife seem to feel that if given the chance, the husband would be back with A in a heartbeat if that opportunity was to come available. A herself was also now married though mention of her husband never came up in the conversation. The husband also continued offering A more and more wine and A began being more and more tipsy and more than willing to share their past escapades.  All of this was making the wife more and more anxious and disappointed. At no time during this evening did she feel her husband new she was around.  When A finally left, the wife was relieved but also visibly shaken at observing this undying devotion between her husband and his former lover, A.       "

I don't mind that her mother visits, but I am angry that she decided on her own that her mother could stay at our house for that long and didn't talk to me about it. In fact, she was nervous and held off talking about it until only a few days before her mother was to visit. I am standing in the living room and my wife is sitting on the couch.

He just said no and that he didn't want anything to do with it. This hurt M's feelings because she had done things like this before for T. It also hurt her feelings because they usually support each other and show up for each other at big events like this. This event was a big deal for M and it would have meant a lot for T to be involved in some way. It also made her angry.

He sits down, exhausted and she begins asking him why he pushed some containers, on the counter, back into the corner. He responds ""well, I was cooking and they were in the way"". She says ""Well, I wanted them there. If I had wanted them in the corner, I would have put them in the corner"". He responds ""Well, you should have told me that. You are always telling me that I need to communicate more"". It is obvious they have had this argument before. He then says, ""When I left to go shopping, and you put the bread mat away, you got mad and said that if I didn't want it put away, I should have told you so"". ""I get mad at the double-standard"". He then gets up and walks out of the room."

I keep asking him questions about what he thought about it, like what he liked and didn't like. Then when I ask him if he is leaning towards yes or no on putting in an offer he completely shuts down, ignores me and doesn't answer. When I ask him again he gets annoyed and gives a very vague answer. I get angry because he always does this, he's not great at communicating. So I just drop it, stay quiet for awhile and then change the subject."
105,133,"I am in our bedroom laying in bed. My girlfriend is lying next to me. It is late at night. I've had a little to drink and I'm feeling randy. I lean over and give her a little kiss on the back of the neck and whisper that, I've been thinking about her. I ask her if she'd like to have sex. She doesn't respond. I shift myself around to where I can see the side of her eye. It is open. I ask again if she's feeling in the mood. Again, she says nothing. I let the question sit in the air for a few minutes before asking again. A ""yes"" is preferable, a ""no"" is alright, but the silence is aggravating. I tell her this. The silence continues and a tear starts to form in her eye. I ask her why can't we just talk about this. I only asked for sex. She likes sex. She is allowed to say no. Just talk to me! After 20 grueling minutes of silence she finally chokes out that she doesn't really want to, but she feels guilty for not wanting to and thinks that it is a fundamental difference between the two of us. She isn't sure that our mismatched sex drivers can ever be resolved. Finally something that we can work on. I listen to her slow and pained words and we start to have a conversation. The tension has passed and now there is a problem to work on."

I walk downstairs and confront my wife. Her smile turns into a frown and she is upset that I'm upset. She decided to buy a new couch because ours hurts her back. She wanted to surprise me with it as she knew I wanted one as well. I'm beyond angry as I would've liked to be a part of this entire process because it was such a large purchase."
85,136,"I was standing in my kitchen and my partner was seated at our kitchen table in the middle of the day (daylight at least). I remember making a joke about food and exercise (I don't remember the specific joke, but imagine it was a sarcastic comment of some kind) toward my partner.

The mother says very little.  She is listening, nodding her head and appearing to be an active listener.  The father comes into room and is agitated by the conversation.

She says okay, still without looking at him,  He snaps at her and says, in a voice that is not yelling but is nonetheless angry ""I know you think that I don't do enough, but I don't know what to tell you except do it your f'ing self."" She opens her mouth to say something, and there is a flash of anger on her face.  Instead she slumps back in her chair, resigned, and says ""ok."""
126,140,"I saw them arguing there, about something so trivial. It was an argument about food. Both seemed to know what food they wanted, but neither wanted to state what they wanted. They seemed to only want to pick things that would make the other happy. This led to an argument. A truce was almost forged over the idea of getting different things, but ultimately that fell through as well. Eventually, neither ate and went to bed hungry and angry. "
88,141,"Partner comes into the room where myself is sleeping. Partner comes up to myself and tells myself something horrible that happened the night before, after I went to sleep, with our friend who came over to hang out and have drinks. I see both parties cry, and myself get very upset. I feel uncomfortable watching this as it is a very personal and sad situation to witness. I feel very bad for myself, having to hear this news, and knowing my child is in the other room none-the-wiser. I  feel sad for this couple to have to deal with this situation now which will likely forever change their lives."

I see my husband come into the room and see me turning the phone in my hand looking confused. I see and hear myself asking my husband ""what is this?"" I see my husband shrinking back a little and hear him tell me ""I was going to tell you about that"". "
184,143,"My husband, who is an very moral and ethical person, was laying bed at night and looking at inappropriate instagram pages without my knowledge.  My daughter somehow figured it out and told me.  I confronted my husband and he admitted what he was doing.  He deleted his instagram account and apologized and felt terrible.  However I was still really really mad and felt pretty violated.  It took me a number of weeks before I had gotten over the event enough to forgive him.

He texts back that she is constantly changing her mind and wants 'more more more'. She doesn't understand what is happening and why he is saying this. Apparently she had forgotten about a previous discussion where they agreed on the size. She gets frustrated and asks him to remind her of the conversation. Instead, he gets frustrated and decides to ignore her for the rest of the day. She feels like he could simply just tell her and there wouldn't be an issue anymore especially since they had previously agreed on it. He feels like she obviously doesn't care to listen to him if the conversation was forgotten."

He had called from work and mentioned he and another man were going to visit a couple from church to ask them why they weren't attending anymore. I fed the kids, no husband. I bathed the kids, no husband. I watched some tv shows with the kids, no husband. That was before we had cell phones, though some people did. I worried about an accident. I put the kids to bed. I sat on the couch and read my Bible and felt sadder and sadder. He finally came home around 10:30, discouraged by his meeting. He didn't want to eat. He didn't want to talk. He didn't even remember it was our anniversary. No card or anything. I think a few days later his mom called and asked what he did for our anniversary and only then did he realize he had forgotten.  I think he was mad at me that I didn't mention it. It took me a long time to get over that."

My daughter is on the left foreground of the scene. There is a binder containing a large number of coins, some coins in baggies and coin holding pages on the table as well. My wife is very angry, I am seemingly calm and my daughter is crying slightly staring at my wife. In my opinion she is going overboard with the saving of the coins but I state I am willing to do it and she is yelling at me because I should be willing to do it without grumbling. I state I am not grumbling just disagreeing but lord that ain't good enough. "

I'm very nervous in vehicles, on the road, and someone started coming off the exit and I flinched thinking we were going to get hit, and said something in surprise, not sure what I said.

I just stayed quiet the rest of the ride until we got to the compassion center, thinking that I know when I yelled it scared him, and that's why he reacted the way he did. But it still hurt."

He said he would be back before midnight. L feels hurt that he can't even take time to call her to let he know he will be late. She feels this would just be a common courtesy.

She said that it was too dangerous to walk, but I felt that she really meant that J, the male mentioned earlier, would not be along. I felt hurt that she felt safe with him, but not me. We argued about this, she denied it, but still refused to go on the walk with me. J, of course,  had no feelings for her, but I felt that my wife did have feelings for him. "

I can still remember the rage in her face as she was screaming at me that she didn't have a problem; that I was the one with the problem for not loving her through thick and thin. This argument occurred in our living room and moved to the bedroom. Pure, unadulterated rage was spewed from both of us, as we both were yelling at the other person to see things from our respective perspectives.

My sisters and I were there and my husband was driving my mother in law to the party. Being the drama queen my mother in law is, she feigned sickness once she arrived. This forced my husband to leave the party and drive her an hour to get back home. This infuriated me because I knew she was acting and he was just giving into to her whim for attention. He missed the entire meal and she asked us to bring her cheeseburgers on the way home."

There's another trip out of bed and I'm still reading, but watching him without staring. He's gone longer, then finally comes back. Gets back into bed, laying on his back. One arm over his eyes, the other on the bed next to me. I shift slightly, still reading, and he reaches his hand out to rest it next to me.

131,158,My husband loves his family. I like his family but do not love or trust them. They always ask him for money. The time they asked to BORROW money upset me when he LOANED the money because I knew they would not pay it back and we would take a loss. It was a large sum in my opinion and he told me he loaned the money after he did it. He did not discuss it with me and it really made me mad. Of course I was right and here we are still waiting to be paid back! He promised me he would never do that again without talking to me first. I let him know that we will NEVER loan or GIVE money to his family again. 
79,159,"I was surprised that my wife was so angry. We were just sitting in the living room, watching TV and reading the newspaper, when she became upset. She said she was still angry and hurt that I had gone on my last SCUBA diving trip. This has been an ongoing issue - in that if I plan a trip, it seems like no matter when I tell I'm thinking about it, she will accuse me of hiding the fact from her. In this case, I had very specifically not made any plans until I had discussed it with her and received her buy-in, but now - over a year later - she is again upset that I made plans for the trip without her acceptance. I'm beginning to get a little frustrated by this behavior."
92,160,"After getting the second dose of vaccination, EK had a tough time but felt better after taking two pills of Tylenol. SK heard EK had was sick during the night EK got the second dose. SK tries to chill EK out by making a joke that EK was pretending to be sick last night. EK got upset right after, telling SK that she genuinely was sick last night and still has a feeling at that moment."
129,161,"I was standing in the garage looking at my boyfriend (who is now my husband).  He was putting tools away on a new tool bench.  It was a warm day in summer and the garage was getting hot.  I was feeling happy watching him work. A nice day, middle of the week.  We had plans to go to the car races Friday night and I was looking forward to our date and had been for weeks.  As I was thinking this, he turned to me and said he was going out Friday night with his friend, Gene, to the car races and I could go too if I wanted.  I was stunned and immediately hurt and felt my face getting hot and my heart racing.  I reminded him that he had asked me to go with him to the races this Friday weeks ago on a date. "
17,162,This happens all to often... subject is upset because her domestic partner does very little to nothing to help around the house. This includes things like cutting the lawn or washing the vehicles every once in a while. 
140,163,"He says he is going out for some drinks with his female bestie from work. His wife strongly objects, saying that he has no right to take out some other girl on a date or whatever when she is present and available. They argue over it for a while before he finally surrenders and doesn't go on the date"
177,164,After engaging in an argue with my wife we had been upset to one another for a long period of time.  We had an argue about our relationship. And she took it to the next level. At the end she admitted her fault but that really made me sad.
169,165,We were in the car on the way to one of our houses. She just got out of work. She seemed down and gloomy and said we need to talk. I just remember trying to concentrate on the road while processing what she was describing what she wanted to do. That was take a break from dating when I go off to college; that it would be best for me to enjoy my college experience to the fullest but not have a relationship with someone at home. Every red light made it feel like the conversation dragged on forever. I just wanted to drop her off at home and curl up in my bed forever. 
173,166,"I was standing in my cabin doorway, my husband had been drinking. He had a history of breaking my phones when he's mad, so I refused to let him have my phone until he sobered up. Despite not usually being physical, when it comes to this, he will grab things from me and overpower me in that sense. He was standing in his blue checkered underwear, at the time, and it was pretty warm and humid out. As I stood on the steps, I think I was facing North. begging him to leave me alone, and go to bed, refusing to argue with him, he knew he had to try some other way to try to also make me angry. He grabbed my new phone from me, one he had bought, and walked down our rock path away from me towards our laundry room. He knew I'd try to grab it back, so he took one of the large rocks, and smashed it with it. I walked around him to the other side, knew it was finished and gave up on the situation. I walked back in the house, and knew we were going to have a serious conversation the next morning. "
24,167,"My brother had called me for my birthday from a different state and he had me on FaceTime. He was visiting one of my exes, and flashed the phone over to him where he said hi and wished me a happy birthday. My husband was driving my car and I was in the backseat. A couple of days later, my husband and I were outside on our front porch smoking a cigarette. It was a fairly nice fall day, and it was Sunday, so we were just relaxing before having to go back to work on Monday. He turned to me and asked if I had gotten to speak to everyone that I wanted to for my birthday. I said yeah, I guess, I had gotten to talk to pretty much all of my family, and several people that I did not really care to talk to. He said that I should be happy because I got to talk to my ex, and that he knew about it, because he was sitting right there. I told him that it was not my choice to speak to my ex, and that I already knew that he knew about it, because he was sitting right there. He accused me of wanting to talk to my ex, and I kept denying it. This went on for several days before he would actually sit down and talk to me about it, and I thought we were going to get divorced over the whole thing. Now, he and my brother hate each other. "
84,168,"There are two people standing in a kitchen -- a man and a woman. The woman is finishing making dinner, and she's busy, with her eye on multiple pots and pans. The man asks her a question about one of their children. The woman starts to answer, and after a minute the man interrupts her with a question about something else. She says she'll answer that question in a moment, but is still answering the first question. The woman resumes her comments, and the man interrupts again with another question -- this one about something else connected to the same child. The woman stops, pauses, and asks the man if he really wants the answers. If he does, she says, he's going to need to be patient because it's complicated. He says he doesn't have time for long answers and leaves the room. "
175,169,"We lived in MD. We were at her place and were figuring out where to live next. I had asked if we wanted to buy, and had put multiple offers, none that worked. I asked her if she would rather rent. She didn't think it was a good idea I had convinced her to buy, not rent. It made me appear waffling."
123,170,I had worked all week and ended up working from home all day on a Friday. I don't have that much to do because it is a new job so once I finished my work I played games and watched TV. My wife came home from her work where she is constantly busy and made several comments that upset me. She would passive aggressively make comments about how I barely work and how I just bummed all day. This upset me because I did the best I could and didn't have anything to do so it was unfair to be mad at me for
216,171,"I am looking at my wife of 36 years as she enters the house after coming home from work and I can tell immediately that she is not in a good mood. Since I am semi-retired I have spent the day doing our grocery shopping, cleaning the house and dealing with a (new) broken clothes dryer. I have been on the phone several times getting the appliance store to send someone over to fix it. Rather than say hello the first thing my wife asks me while using a derogatory tone is what I have been doing all day. I understand that it has been a trying day for her but I think to myself, ""really is that all you can say to me."" Although not really a big deal it is an action that can set back a relationship for a few minutes.  Just slight cuts that anyone who is married over the course of years faces but quickly recovers."
51,172,"Back in the day before we got married, my wife spent a lot of time cleaning the house. She took about 3 hours cleaning and put a lot of time into it. When she was making dinner, she opened a can of black beans and let some of the juice run out on the counter. As I got home I told her that she has to be careful, otherwise the juice would stain the counter. She got very upset and started yelling at me about it, then stormed out of the house. I felt so confused and I didn't know what to do, so I got really upset and was mad for the rest of the day. We never spoke about it since."
38,173,"I had a relationship with a girl before I got married. That girl cheated on me once. She flirted with some one an went his house. I saw it, but I did not tell her. Then after next day when she came home I asked her about last night. She was lying at that time and I feel so hurt. I broke up with her and moved on. "
50,174,Our daughter called me to talk about how her eye started twitching again like it did a few years ago and hadn't gone away in a few weeks.  I found my husband and put the phone on speaker so he could be included in the conversation.  Our daughter was wondering what doctor she should go see.  My husband said she should go see a primary care doctor.  I mentioned maybe she should see an allergist also since it could be allergy related.  My husband got frustrated and mad and used an angry tone and again repeated to see a primary care doctor.  I told him to stop using that tone immediately and asked why he was mad.  He got upset that I said that while our daughter was on the phone and embarrassed him.  
114,175,"I had a bit of a thing for this girl C for over a year back in school. I used to speak to her whenever I could. I'd help her with her English homework, sit next to her on the bus, etc. The typical teenage romance crap. C and I both had a liking for this local band who had made it relatively big, so for her birthday, I got two tickets to see them at a homecoming show as a way of asking her out. I put the tickets in her card and wrote some crap about looking forward to taking her. Her birthday comes around, I give her the card, watch her open it, get a hug and a massive thank you, etc., but that was about it. I didn't think too much of the lack of comments regarding the 'asking out' part. Concert day rolls around, I text her asking when she wants to get pick up. She doesn't understand what I mean and tells me she's already on her way there with *****. Turns out she went with another guy. They started dating for a year or two."
194,176,"We are in our home office where we both work on our computers. I'm standing near my desk, and my wife is sitting at hers. She's focused on an unexpected meeting that is about to end, and I'm trying to get her attention. Our son is playing in the next room, and it's just before Noon. I'm letting her know I made lunch for everyone and I want to be sure she takes a break to eat so she doesn't get too stuck in her work and forget. I have to leave for an appointment, and I'm letting her know everything is setup. She rudely snaps at me and tells me she doesn't need to know about all that because she's busy with work."
43,177,"He went downstairs to get something off of the computer, and he took a long time, and I had a sinking feeling that he was beginning to go through my files and/or conversations -- snooping around my computer. My feelings were justified as when he came upstairs he confronted me and told me this is what he had done, and he didn't like the conversation I had been having with one of my friends. My friend had been flirting with me, but it was very one sided; I was not interested in pursuing anything with him. This snooping made me upset and paranoid because I wasn't going to cheat. "
179,178,"It's clear that relationship conflict occurs because expectations aren't being met. ... A lot of couples see conflict as a time to bail either because they were already looking for a way out or because they freak out and feel threatened. When our ego feels threatened, it activates our flight-or-fight response. I can think myself being in the same position while arguing with my wife. "
32,179,"The scene was set on the afternoon of J's birthday where J and his wife K sat in the kitchen. While there were no set plans for the evening, K uttered to J, ""for your birthday, let's get steaks and have a nice home-made dinner at home tonight"". J said, ""because you never told me of any plans, I am going out to dinner with my friends."" K reported, ""that's not fair that you're going out with your friends when I had a plan for us to enjoy a nice, evening birthday dinner"". ""Well, then maybe you should've told me your plans before I made my own - I thought you didn't plan anything and I had to make my own birthday plans!"" K exited the room in tears."
67,180,"I told her to use my car yesterday because hers was a bit faulty but she went ahead to use her faulty car. When her car broke down, she left it in a parking lot, told me to go take care of it and took a bus"
58,181,"My boyfriend and I were at the store and I was looking for clothes. He really didn't want to be there. I saw clothes I liked but realized that they were too small and I could not fit into them.  I stated, I don't know anyone who is that small. He stated, my ex-wife was. At that instance, I was hurt and angry. I stated, lets go and we walked out the door. I think I may have told him that he is a jerk and stopped talking to him. He just looked at me because he only stated a fact. He did not realize how saying that hurt me which then made me feel silly and ashamed.  "
56,182,"My husband and I had plans one night when we weren't yet married and living together. He was at his cousin's house during the day but he was supposed to come over to my house that night for dinner and to watch a movie. Well he kept pushing the time back later and later. I ended up eating dinner alone just fuming over him not being on time and making our plans a priority. He ended up showing up to my house 2.5 hours late, not long before I planned on going to bed. I was extremely angry at him for not making it on time and not putting us first instead of a last minute hang out with his cousin that he could have done another time. "
159,183,I was upset that my spouse would violate our trust. We had agreed on us not spending for the month from that account. I was angry that she thought I wouldn't find out. We are very good together and always do and say what we are going to do. I had a talk with her and she agreed it was something that should have not happened. We kissed and made up. It was good moment in our marriage after we both understood that the little tings in life really matter. Trust is something that once violated is hard to get back. It sometimes takes awhile before one can trust again. We take this for granted sometimes.
95,184,"The event was my husband and I arguing over private personal hang ups that we both have. We were both very emotional and upset at more so ourselves that we felt we weren't good enough for each other. My eyes are on the verge of tears from being both sad and frustrated as we continue to discuss our problems together. His face hold a very sad expression too, though he isn't about to cry like I am. As we talk things out, we come to a mutual understanding and eventually we hug and both apologize and promise to do better for each other. He smiles at me as we hug and then proceed to talk about future things together."
4,185,"My then-boyfriend M was clearly having some internal struggles, but he refused to talk to me about what was going on with him. I tried to talk to him multiple times and he would just shut down, leaving to go for long walks alone instead. Eventually he told me he was ready to talk, and he let me know that he had come to the conclusion that we should break up. There was no discussion or explanation, other than him saying he was afraid to tie himself down to one person when he was only a senior in college. I was furious that he would rather ""have fun"" and sleep around than commit himself to me."
45,186,"I am holding my son in my arms. He's fretting and pulling at my shirt because he wants to be fed. My husband is standing in front of me, upset about something I've just said to him about money and the fact that he isn't bringing any in at the moment. I dismiss him with a, ""You can just go now."" and try to move around him, but instead, he raises his arms and pushes against me, causing me to trip and nearly fall while holding my son. I sit down hard in my rocking chair, then stand up, put my son in the crib beside me, where he starts to cry, and ask my husband if he meant to do that. "
118,187,"My wife did not want to make her family feel bad so we stayed on an air mattress on the floor of their home during a visit. I told  her lets rent a room. After a few days, my back was hurting and I could not make myself to spend another night on the air mattress. We had an argument and I slept another damn night on the air mattress. "
19,188,I remember that my wife threw something to me and it got me in the eye and her reaction was to laugh. 
158,189,"Husband asked me to button his pants. I pulled and pulled but could not get the hole anywhere near the button. I said that he must have gained weight as the pants were too small. That he could barely get the other pair button and they were a larger size. He lashed back saying, yeah, right, slim in a negative voice. I said ""Well, at least my clothes fit."" and I walked away until I could calm down as I had to go back and finish helping him dress as he had surgery and isn't supposed to use one arm. He later told our daughter that I didn't try very hard and I told her that I pulled as much as I could, the waist was just too small. "
166,190,My partner flirts' with a certain individual and this have made me feel extremely sad.

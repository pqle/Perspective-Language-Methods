He had already set up his new monitor and keyboard so we just had to plug in all the USB and display cables into their corresponding ports. Once that was all and finish, I lent him a USB drive with the windows installer. We installed Windows and the computer was then officially completed. All that was left to do was for him to install all his programs and games, which took a bit of time since the internet connection was not that fast. As the programs were installing, we decided to pass the time by playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate on his switch. We invited another friend over and played for hours into the night. We actually pulled an all-nighter playing since we were so hyped up on soda and energy drinks that the next morning we decided to go to Starbucks and The Official Pancake House.

229,"Visual imagery plays a prominent role in mental simulations of past and future events: people tend to “see” events in their mind's eye when they think about them. When picturing events people often use their own first-person perspective, looking out at the situation through their own eyes. However, other times people use a third-person perspective, so that they see themselves in the image from the visual perspective an observer would have. This chapter presents a theoretical model proposing that imagery perspective functions to determine whether people understand events bottom-up, in terms of the phenomenology evoked by concrete features of the pictured situation (first-person), or top-down, in terms of abstractions that integrate the pictured event with its broader context (third-person). This model integrates existing findings and generates novel predictions that challenge widespread assumptions about the function that imagery perspective serves. We review a program of research that supports these predictions, demonstrating the role of imagery perspective in defining the experiential and conceptual facets of the self, determining emotional responses to recalled and imagined life events, and shaping forecasts of future behavior and emotion. We conclude by discussing how the proposed model helps to distinguish the visual dimension of perspective from other dimensions on which perspective may vary. We consider how this model connects with other theories concerning the self and event representation, and we explore the implications for classic and contemporary areas of social psychological inquiry including attribution, social perspective-taking, culture, emotional coping, and top-down versus bottom-up processing.",93.56,83.56,74.76,39.75,32,34.38,80.86,41.41,10.16,4.3,0,1.56,0,0,2.73,5.86,7.42,15.23,1.17,3.52,7.03,0,7.42,3.52,1.95,2.34,1.56,0.39,2.73,1.56,0.78,0,0,0,11.33,0,0,0,0,17.19,8.59,3.12,0.39,2.73,0,3.12,4.69,4.69,0,0,1.17,0.78,0.39,0,0,7.81,2.73,1.95,3.52,0.39,0,0.39,5.08,1.95,13.67,0.78,8.59,4.3,1.95,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.23,3.12,5.47,0.39,0,0,0,3.52,0.78,0.39,1.56,0,29,30.77,-1,"ProudEM",NA,247

385,"Jennifer sat in the living room with her oud.  Learning to compose a piece for the upcoming championship for her medieval re-enactment group would be hard.  She frowned as she tuned the instrument.   Composing a piece in a historic Ottoman mode and rhythm would be especially hard after never having composed anything her whole life.  She tapped out a few rhythms on the body of her oud, thinking what would be interesting to compose in.  She tapped out the 17th century rhythm devri revan - 1-2-3 1-2-1-2 1-2-3 1-2-1-2 and thought that sounded compelling and fun to compose in.  She noodled around in a variety of musical modes with her oud, thinking of what mode sounded appealing and would be interesting and fun.  Slowly as she played form and melody took shape.  She set her oud back down in its stand, and picked up a pencil and the book of staff paper for sheet music that a friend have given her a few months later.  Alternating between playing parts of the new piece in her head and writing down phrases, in the course of a few hours the completed sheet music for the new tune had taken shape.  And she'd composed her first tune ever.  And it wasn't just any tune, but a pesrev - a complicated 4 part tune - in a historic Ottoman mode and rhythm.  She went upstairs, showed her husband the completed sheet music, then played through the whole tune on her oud for him.

I had been married about 15 years at that time. My husband was in the army and away from home about 70% of the time. I started working for a temp company and one of the jobs was at a community college. I was pretty naive and this ""older man"" (he was only 4 years older than me, but I felt like the age difference was more like 15 years) 'came on' to me. Right away he called me ""pretty girl"" and just laid it on pretty thick. I had no idea how this would impact my life. Anyway, I just thought this guy was amazing. He was married and he told me how unhappy he was (yes, yada, yada). I ended up having an affair and leaving my husband and destroying my marriage. When I could see straight, I realized that I was just one of many. This guy had money, a job that didn't require any work, and time to do whatever he wanted. I should have realized what was happening, but I was miserable, too. I also had a health issue that was not diagnosed at the time that played into all of this. My kids basically lost their dad because of me. It is difficult 'seeing' this from the third-person perspective. I am picturing myself walking in the door for the first time and things like that.

After the inside of the Shoe is navigated, the students all approach the light at the end of the tunnel, and then shield their eyes as they meet the bright sunny sky again. Zack and his peers now stand on the sidelines. They can hear the presenter announcing names and then some clapping from the bleachers above and around them. Zack is chewing gum, and he's nervous for no reason so he chews the gum even more. He knows his mom will notice as he approaches the stairs up to the stage. He isn't sure why he is so nervous, everyone around him is doing the exact same thing. But anyways, he continues chomping on his mint gum, and then he simply walks up, shakes a hand and has a picture taken.

One of my bosses would sit at the desk next to me where she would answer phones where she would speak to clients and customers alike. I would spend my work day correcting and designing ads in Indesign, answering emails to sales representatives and my other boss, organizing files, compiling ads into future booklets, and doing minor updates on ads for future release 1-2 months in advance.

75,"I was attending a seminar at my college's auditorium around 2pm on Thursday March 5th. The seminar was about sex trafficking in Texas with a panel consisting of a survivor, a judge, a police sheriff, and a lady that was a head of an organization that was working towards helping survivors of trafficking with free resources if possible. I can see myself walk into the auditorium looking for my teacher or any of my fellow classmates but the front room was crowded. Thankfully a person saw me looking around and said I should sign in on the clipboard with my name and my teachers name located on the left side of the room. I see myself walking to the table where there are a line of about 3 students signing in. Once I signed my name in, I notice that I turn to look at some stalls that are set up in the room that have information about trafficking, domestic violence, and women's safety. Since I had arrived later I did not get a chance to look at all the booths so I decided to go inside the auditorium to secure a seat before the panel started. I observe myself taking a seat in the middle section of seats near the exiting row in case my seminar went past the time it stated so I can go to my next class. The seminar started with the a woman introducing the panel and preparing us to hear from the survivor. I can only really recall some of what was said because the seminar contained a lot of information and was deeply emotional, especially when the survivor told her story. I had to leave from the lecture before it was over since I had another class to attend to. Hearing the information about how my state was a hot spot for trafficking was alarming and unsettling so I was glad I was able to attend so I was made more aware of what is happening around me.",90.74,29.54,94.22,36.25,27.92,18.81,90.45,56.42,13.13,10.15,9.55,0.3,0,0.3,0,2.99,11.34,17.61,7.46,5.37,5.07,0.3,15.22,2.99,1.49,1.49,0.6,2.39,2.99,1.79,1.19,0.6,0,0,5.67,0,0.6,1.19,0.3,8.06,2.09,1.49,0.6,2.69,0.6,1.49,3.58,2.09,1.19,0.3,0.6,0.3,0,0.3,0,5.67,0.3,1.79,2.09,0.6,0.9,8.66,6.27,0.3,18.21,3.28,10.45,4.18,5.97,0,1.19,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.27,3.58,2.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,NA,27.61,1,"COVIDwave1",NA,335

191,"I flew to New York for my best friend Max's wedding. I booked a weird but interesting ""micro"" suite hotel to stay in near Midtown. There were lots of people visiting there from Europe and some sort of fancy event in the hotel. The actual wedding was in lower Manhattan so I suited up and took the subway. It was very crowded and full of all sorts of people, as it always is. The wedding was conducted in the traditional Jewish way in the venue hall of a beer brewery so it had a very cool ""industrial chic"" look to it. Lots of old friends I hadn't seen in a few years were there with me and it was great fun to catch up. We all had a 4 course meal and danced for a few hours.

The stylist understood and escorted her to get her hair washed by another worker. Afterwards, the girl was directed to sit on one of the chairs and the coloring process started.

By about 1am we were fully in the groove, dancing next to each other, fully immersed in the feel of the music, only occasionally looking up to check on the other person or see what other people were doing.

I'm specifically remembering the process of flying: arriving at the airport, unloading bags from the car and taking them over to the check-in desk outside, figuring out whose bag is whose and which passports will be associated with which bag, etc. My dad parked the car, so we took his bags to check them in as well, and then he met us in the line for security. I love travel and flying, so this memory is very fond. I love walking through the airport and seeing all the people, and this trip was no different. All kinds of people from all different places milling about, finding food, talking on phones, shopping at kiosks, etc. My family and I wandered through the terminal, my sister and I got coffees, we found our gate at our pace, and then folks went to go find the bathroom or settle into reading or scrolling our phones. My sister and I were sat next to each other on the plane, so we watched a movie together. I think it was Knives Out, but I can't remember totally. I always get coffee and cookies when the flight attendants bring the snack cart around. Taking off is exhilarating - I love the moment when the plane lifts off the ground and that incredible, insurmountable force of gravity is temporarily pushed back.
